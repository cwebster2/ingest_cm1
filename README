Ingest_cm1

README

Ingest_cm1 is a Fortran module to abstract access to model output 
files from George Bryan's CM1 cloud model.  

The current version of this module supports access to GrADS style files
with one output file per timestep or one output file per timestep per
MPI node.  These represent files created by the following options in the
CM1 namelist.input file:

   output_format = 1
   output_filetpe = 2 or 3

Future output format support is expected for NetCDF4/HDF output.

GETTING THE SOFTWARE

$ git clone https://github.com/cwebster2/ingest_cm1.git

INSTALLING

$ cd ingest_cm1/src; make

USING

The fortran mod file is written to include/ and the library to lib/
(relative to the root of this repository).  See the test_cm1.f90 file
for examples of use of the module.
